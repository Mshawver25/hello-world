# hello-world
My first repository

Currently working through this hello-world tuturial. Im learning a lot about Github so far. I am 
excited to see what sorts of cool stuff can be done with such a powerful platform. ALso, I suppose 
I could discuess a bit about myself considering that would be following the directions of the tutorial.
I live in the Puget Sound are of Washington state. I am an identical twin. One of my deepest passions
is interactive media, video games, to be more specific. As a 90's baby, I grew up on the N64 and loved to
spend my time exploring Hyrule and the classic Super Mario world. My passion for video games has driven me
to follow my dreams of creating interactive media. My first step was a Bachelor's in Game Design which I 
earned from Full Sail University. Though my time in University was enjoyable, I discovered a deeper appreciation 
for development in particular. I have a deep interest in problem solving and critical thinking. This has brought
me to Github where I am hoping to explore new skills and possibly create new connections that will foster a 
lifestyle of working on projects that others will love in much the same way I love/d games.

Thanks for reading!
