# hello-world
My first repository

Currently working through this hello-world tuturial. Im learning a lot about Github so far. I am 
excited to see what sorts of cool stuff can be done with such a powerful platform. I suppose 
I could discuss a bit about myself. I live in the Puget Sound area of Washington state. I am an identical twin. 
One of my deepest passions is interactive media, video games, to be more specific. As a 90's baby,
I grew up on the N64 and loved to spend my time exploring Hyrule and the classic Super Mario world. My passion for 
video games has driven me to follow my dreams of creating interactive media. My first step on my journey was a Bachelor's in 
Game Design from Full Sail University. Though my time in university studying game design was enjoyable, I discovered a deeper appreciation 
for development in particular. I have a deep interest in problem solving and critical thinking, which, has brought
me to Github. I am hoping to explore new skills and possibly create new connections that will foster a 
lifestyle of working on projects that others will love in much the same way I love/d games.

Thanks for reading!
